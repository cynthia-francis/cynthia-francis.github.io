I am a senior at the [Lebanese American University](https://www.lau.edu.lb/) finishing my [BS in Mathematics](https://soas.lau.edu.lb/academics/programs/bs-mathematics.php) as a [Merit Scholarship Recipient](https://www.lau.edu.lb/apply/financial-aid/scholarships.php). I recently completed the [Equitech Scholars Program](https://www.equitechfutures.com/program/esp), an intensive 8-week program tailored for undergraduates and focuses on equipping them with the skills needed to leverage data science and artificial intelligence for positive social impact.

My career aspirations extend beyond my undergraduate studies, as I am driven to delve further into the realm of technology and data science through graduate studies. My ultimate goal is to channel these advanced technical tools towards addressing critical societal challenges, with a particular focus on transforming the education sector.

### Highlighted Coursework: 
Linear Algebra; Complex Analysis; Real Analysis; Probability and Statistics; Numerical Methods; Partial Differential Equations; Abstract Algebra; Introduction to Topology; Database Management Systems (SQL); Object-Oriented Programming (Python); Objects and Data Abstraction (Java); Technology Ethics
