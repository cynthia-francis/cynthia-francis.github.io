I am a senior at the [Lebanese American University](https://www.lau.edu.lb/) finishing my [BS in Mathematics](https://soas.lau.edu.lb/academics/programs/bs-mathematics.php). I recently completed the [Equitech Scholars Program](https://www.equitechfutures.com/program/esp), an 8-week program for undergraduates to learn how to use data science and AI for social impact. My goal is to pursue graduate studies in the field of technology and data science to address social issues, particularly education.

### Highlighted Coursework: 
Linear Algebra; Complex Analysis; Real Analysis; Probability and Statistics; Numerical Methods; Partial Differential Equations; Abstract Algebra; Introduction to Topology; Database Management Systems (SQL); Object-Oriented Programming (Python); Objects and Data Abstraction (Java); Technology Ethics
