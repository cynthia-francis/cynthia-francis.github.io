I received the Grow with Google scholarship to complete 8 online courses, developed by Google, that include hands-on, practice-based data analytics assessments. For the capstone project, I prepared, processed, analyzed, and shared data to improve the marketing strategy of Bellabeat. Using R, I analyzed fitness tracker data and designed data visualizations to support my marketing recommendations.
